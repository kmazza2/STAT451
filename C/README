This code implements solutions to the problems in STAT 451 HW3. Run `make' to build, `make check' to run the tests, `make run' to execute a demo, `make clean' to remove build artifacts.

A Dockerfile is provided so that this code can be run on any system. To create and enter the container:
```
docker build -t ucs .
docker run -it ucs
```

The function ucs_ascent is broken. Do not use it.
