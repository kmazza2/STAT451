This directory contains a Python package implementing solutions to the HW 4 problems. I have attempted to ensure reproducibility by using a build tool (poetry) which enforces dependency requirements. After installing poetry, run
```
poetry install
poetry run src/hw4/hw4.py
poetry run python -m unittest
```
from the STAT451/hw4 directory to run the code for the homework assignment and execute the tests.
