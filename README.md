This directory contains a Python package implementing solutions to the HW 4 problems. I have attempted to ensure reproducibility by creating a Docker container for this project. Inside the container, running the following will execute the homework programs and tests:
```
cd STAT451
git checkout HW4
python3 hw4.py
python3 -m unittest
```
