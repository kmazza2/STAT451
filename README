This branch contains an R package implementing solutions to the homework problems as demos. In the directory STAT451/R/hw3, running `R CMD BUILD .' followed by `R CMD INSTALL hw3_1.0.tar.gz' allows you to load the package in an R session with `library(hw3)'. Then the demos in STAT451/R/hw3/demo can be run inside the R session with, for example, `demo(p3_em)'. For the sake of testability and code reuse, the implementations have been split between files in STAT451/R/hw3/R and STAT451/R/hw3/demo: the R directory contains the core algorithms, while the demo directory contains algorithm code specific to the problems at hand.
